This contains a list of questions I get asked through email or friends! <br/>
_**Disclaimer: These are based on my experience and should be taken as official response!**_

- **Are International Students eligible for [ORISE (OakRidge Science) Fellowships](https://orise.orau.gov/) ?** <br/>
    International students can apply to most ORISE fellowships (unless the position is only for US citizens). 
    If accepted, you will be required to change your visa to J1 - long/short
    term research scholar depending on the length of the position. Since the J1 exchange visitor visa is sponsored
    by the US government or use government funds, you **WILL** be subject to **Two-Year Home-Country Physical Presence Requirement** 
    also called 212(e). 

- **How long does it take to get the waiver ?** <br/>
    There's no official timeline on the process. However, based on my experience and others, it usually takes about an year to 
    hear something back from USCIS. (I applied in 2017).

- **What is the process to apply for the 212(e) waiver ?** <br/>
    _This question deserves its own post! I will one day write about the process._<br/>
    Applying for the J1 212(e) waiver is a three step process
    - Apply to the US Department of State for the Waiver
    - Get a No Objection Certification (NOC) or No Obligation to Return to India (NORI) from your home government<br/>
        _Note: Do check with the embassy in your jurisdiction for details on the process._<br/>
        For India, this is a three step process [click Here](https://www.indianembassyusa.gov.in/extra?id=18). <br/>
        To get a No objection certificate 
        - Apply to NOC at the Indian Embassy (you need the application # from step 1)
        - Get a NOC from
            - Indian government
            - State government
            - The passport office that issued your passport.
        - After you receive all NOC's, submit these back to the Indian embassy. The Indian embassy will officially forward the NOC 
        to the Department of State
    - The Department of state would either recommend or reject the application of the waiver
    - If recommended for waiver, the Department of State forwards your application to USCIS. USCIS makes the final decision based on the 
    recommendation. Good luck!
